      <h1>Rabbits like companions</h1>
      <p>
        Rabbits are great companions, especially when they have the freedom and
        opportunity to show their wonderful personalities!

        Cute, fuzzy, fluffy and hopping mad, who doesn’t love these adorable
        creatures, also known as bunnies? Check out our top ten rabbit facts!

      <h3>10 interesting facts about rabbits</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe and a male is
          called a buck.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups. They live in
          warrens — a series of tunnels and rooms that they dig underground.
        </li>
        <li>
          A rabbit’s teeth never stop growing! Instead, they’re gradually worn
          down as the rabbit chews on grasses, wildflowers and vegetables —
          meaning they never get too long.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a ‘binky‘, when they’re
          happy — performing twists and kicks in mid air!
        </li>
        <li>
          Rabbits’ eyes are on the sides of their head, meaning they can see
          almost all the way around them. This helps them to keep a close watch
          for predators while they’re going about their business!
        </li>
        <li>
          A bunny’s big ears aren’t just for listening! They also help regulate
          the rabbit’s body temperatures. The ears’ blood vessels swell when
          it’s hot out, and contract when it’s cold.
        </li>
        <li>
          Growing up to 10 centimetres in length, those amazing ears can also be
          rotated almost a full circle to 270 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
          To some, rabbits might seem like quiet pets, but they’re actually
          capable of making a lot of sounds, including growling, screeching,
          chattering their teeth, and even honking softly! Talk about adorable!
        </li>
        <li>
          Rabbits can hop and BOY can they also jump! In fact, rabbits can jump
          to impressive heights and distances….a little over 3 feet high and a
          whopping 10 feet long!
        </li>
        <li>Like cats, happy rabbits purr when they’re content and relaxed.</li>

        Rabbits need large cages or exercise pens kept indoors for health,
        safety and socialization purposes! And, they need plenty of daily
        supervised time outside of their cages or pens to play and exercise. Be
        sure to bunny-proof your home and do not leave them unattended during
        this time.

        local shelter where there are often adoptable rabbits.
